        <h2>Holdspace - </h2>
        <h4>Carlos Yusim</h4>
        <h3>Information design:</h3>
        <p>The clarity of this website is simple and straightforward. Carlos Yusim uses negative space with black and white shades in the background to effectively highlight the key message of “Holdspace.” The layout is centered, using hierarchy to emphasize important information. The central message has higher visibility due to its larger size and longer sentence. The words at the bottom of the screen also represent key information; although minimized, they still contrast well with the background. The designer’s name is displayed in larger, bold text than the libraries used, drawing more attention from users. Carlos focuses on text in his UI, making the interaction accessible and easy to navigate by clearly presenting the message. The black-and-white color scheme creates strong contrast that effectively highlights the main information of “Holdspace” and guides users in their interactions.
            The visual information is strong and engaging. The animation of the decagon and triangular shapes when released and held continuously changes size and rotates, providing a dynamic visual experience. The synchronization of the animation with the beat of the sound deeply immerses users in the audio-visual experience.
        </p>
        <h3>Mapping:</h3>
        <p>The main interaction Carlos uses is a natural control that links the underlying system with the website’s visuals. Users can hold the spacebar to start the soundtrack and release it to pause and reverse the playback. While the soundtrack is playing, a shape appears that is synchronized with both the beats and the animation of the decagon. When the spacebar is released, the decagon transforms into a triangular shape, which animates and gradually shrinks until it disappears. Another interaction involves clicking: clickable elements are designed in bold to encourage discovery. When hovering over these elements, the mouse cursor changes to a pointer, providing a clear visual cue that they are clickable. Overall, the mapping is simple and intuitive, making the interaction easy to understand and use.
        </p>
        <h3>Characterisation:</h3>
        <p>The overall aesthetic of “Holdspace” is simple, using the contrast of black and white to highlight key elements such as text and shape animations. Carlos applies a sans-serif typography with light and regular font weights, creating a clean and minimal visual style. “Holdspace” uses geometric shapes as its visual imagery, with animated changes that work in harmony with the sound. This contrasts with the overall visual simplicity the soundtrack is playful, featuring strong beats and swinging rhythms that energize the mood without feeling unexpected.
        </p>
        <h3>Feedback:</h3>
        <p>As users control the soundtrack, feedback is provided through a progress bar displayed across the top of the screen, although it can be somewhat difficult to interpret. The change in animation also serves as feedback; instead of using a common loading icon, Carlos uses the animations of two different geometric shapes to represent forward and backward movement. This approach is novel and makes the interaction more interesting.

        <h2>Liquid Entropy - </h2>
        <h4>Mika Chernov | Sinjin Hawke</h4>
        <h3>Information design:</h3>
        <p>The layout design is clear, with two distinct functional sections that allow users to choose and adjust settings without confusion. These areas are separated to prevent users from mixing different functionalities. At the top of the website are options for selecting different scenes, while various controls are framed below, on the left side. The proportional difference between these sections also indicates which area the designer expects users to interact with more frequently.
            The majority of the website is occupied by the main interactive visual, "Liquid Entropy," which establishes a strong visual hierarchy, clearly distinguishing between primary content and optional features. The size of the text further supports this hierarchy. The name of the website is displayed in a larger, more stylized font, immediately drawing the user’s attention. The control panel is appropriately sized, allowing users to easily read and interact with each adjustable parameter. In contrast, the bottom-left corner features a small, almost unreadable label, which contains descriptive information about the website.
        </p>
        <h3>Mapping:</h3>
        <p>The main canvas of the website is directly interactive, offering a straightforward user experience. Hovering the mouse over the canvas traces the liquid and triggers real-time visual flows, providing intuitive control and immediate feedback to the user. The adjustable control panel influences both the behavior of the liquid flow and the background sound effects. These adjustments alter the audio, ranging from smooth to chaotic.
        </p>
        <h3>Characterisation:</h3>
        <p>The overall characterisation is chaotic in both the visual and audio elements. However, the audio is adjustable by the user, and this controllability helps refine the distorted sound, making the experience more manageable. The main interactive visuals are playful, encouraging user engagement and immersion. This characterisation sparks curiosity, prompting users to experiment with the controls to explore different effects.    
        </p>
        <h3>Feedback:</h3>
        <p>Before entering the website, there is a loading icon to show the progression of load, the highlight of Liquid Entropy is its real-time visual feedback of the molten, metallic liquid. Most adjustments respond simultaneously to both visual and audio feedback, such as refraction with reverb, mouse size with vibrato rate, lookup ratio with lowpass, and lightness with voice. This design simplifies interaction by linking parameters, allowing users to influence both visuals and sound without needing to adjust them separately.

        <h2>contrast </h2>
        <h3>Information design:</h3>
        <p>Both websites use a clear visual hierarchy to guide the user’s navigation and utilize contrast to highlight the important information the designer wants to convey. The designs focus on user engagement and attention through interactive, visual, and audio elements. Additionally, the typography in both websites indicates information priority. Holdspace uses a minimalist color scheme, whereas Liquid Entropy features fluid visuals as the main focus and is chaotic in both sound and visuals. Holdspace relies on animated geometric shapes paired with sound to attract user interaction.
        </p>
        <h3>Mapping:</h3>
        <p>Holdspace focuses on minimalism and emphasizes clarity to guide the user journey. Liquid Entropy values freedom and exploration, fostering a more experimental user relationship. Both websites are playful through the close connection of audio and visuals, encouraging user engagement to create a more immersive experience.
        </p>
        <h3>Characterisation:</h3>
        <p>
            Holdspace focuses on minimalism and emphasizing clarity which guides the user journey. Liquid entropy values freedom and exploration, developing a more experimental user relationship. Both websites are playful through the close connection of the audio and visuals, encouraging user engagement to enhance a more immersive experience.
        </p>
        <h3>Feedback:</h3>
        <p>Holdspace uses symbolic and artistic feedback, which enhances its overall playfulness; however, it lacks clarity in immediate feedback. In contrast, Liquid Entropy focuses on real-time, integrated feedback that promotes seamless interaction while emphasizing the visual effects of intuitive user control. Both websites integrate audio and visuals to enhance the user’s experience when interacting with UI elements.
